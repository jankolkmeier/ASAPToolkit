# ASAPToolkit

This is a minimal starter project to quickly setup a minimal unity virtual human driven by ASAP.
This is to be used in conjuction with the unity toolkit [ASAPToolkitUnity](https://github.com/ArticulatedSocialAgentsPlatform/ASAPToolkitUnity)

## Requirements

- Have java/jdk 1.8 installed and JAVA_HOME environment variable configured correctly (i.e. ```C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_261``` on windows)
- [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) in path. (newer versions might also work).
- Python 2.7 in path / as the default python (sorry)
- Have an activemq broker running (on default port: 61616). ActiveMQ Classic and Artemis both work. Tested with the default broker (anonymous login enabled!)  & service setup[described here](http://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/1.0.0/running-server.html)
